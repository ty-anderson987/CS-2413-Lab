# CS-2413 Data Structures Lab

This repository contains projects for the Data Structures Lab, demonstrating the implementation and application of fundamental data structures including linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, and graphs. Each lab is divided into two parts, focusing on specific operations and algorithms.

## Lab 1: Linked List Manipulation

**Part A – Removing & Searching Elements**  
- Implemented operations to **remove elements** from a singly linked list based on value.  
- Added functionality to **search for specific elements** within the list.  
- Focused on proper pointer manipulation and dynamic memory management.

**Part B – Reversing & Displaying Linked List**  
- Implemented a function to **reverse the linked list**.  
- Developed a **display function** to output the current state of the list.  
- Demonstrated understanding of node traversal and linked list structure.

## Lab 2: Stack & Queue Hybrid Implementation

**Part A – Stack Using Queues**  
- Implemented a **stack data structure using one or more queues**.  
- Supported standard operations: **push, pop, and display**.  
- Showcased conversion between linear data structures and algorithm design skills.

**Part B – Queue Using Stacks**  
- Implemented a **queue using one or more stacks**.  
- Supported standard operations: **enqueue, dequeue, and display**.  
- Highlighted problem-solving using alternative data structure implementations.

## Lab 3: Binary Tree Traversal

**Part A – In-Order Traversal**  
- Built a **binary tree structure** using nodes and pointers.  
- Implemented **in-order traversal** (left subtree → root → right subtree).  
- Demonstrated recursive traversal and understanding of hierarchical data access.

**Part B – Pre-Order Traversal**  
- Implemented **pre-order traversal** (root → left subtree → right subtree).  
- Highlighted recursive function design and traversal logic.  
- Reinforced understanding of binary tree operations and node visitation order.

## Lab 4: Symmetric Tree & Graph Traversal

**Part A – Symmetric Tree Check**  
- Implemented a function to **check if a binary tree is symmetric**.  
- Applied recursion and tree node comparison for symmetry verification.  
- Demonstrated analytical skills in tree structure evaluation.

**Part B – Graph Traversal (DFS & BFS)**  
- Implemented **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithms for graphs.  
- Represented graphs using **adjacency lists or adjacency matrices**.  
- Explored traversal algorithms for connectivity and path analysis.
